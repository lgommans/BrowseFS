Contributions of any kind are very welcome!

Regarding code style, a tab width of 4 is recommended. Using spaces or tabs
doesn't really matter, but keep it consistent. Simply look how the code around
you is structured and structure accordingly.

The code might still heavily change. Remember to pull regularly!

Improvements to make (most important first):

* Find a cleaner way to serve static files
* Support themes
* Perhaps use Github Issues instead of this file (I use this because it's all
  local for me now)
* See also TODO and !TODO items (exclamation point is urgent, others are mere
  improvements).

New features to build:

* Create new folders
* Recent files
* Manipulate existing files and folders. This must be done by selecting the
  file/folder you want to manipulate and then using the as-of-yet unexistent
  action bar on the right top.
* New files (on the left)
* Go to a folder by typing (with autocompletion)
* Keyboard navigation in general
