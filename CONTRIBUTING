Contributions of any kind are very welcome! Example contributions could include
a better code structure (e.g. a better way to serve the static files, or making
theming possible in Javascript), new or extended features, grammar corrections,
bug fixes, etc.

Regarding code style, a tab width of 4 is recommended. Using spaces or tabs
doesn't really matter, but keep it consistent. Simply look how the code around
you is structured and structure accordingly.

The code might still heavily change. Remember to pull regularly!
